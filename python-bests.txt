Read input from stdin
import sys
a = sys.stdin.readline()

Readline and convert 12 23 453 23 12 into integer list
arr = list(map(int,input().split()))

Sorting
arr.sort() 
It uses tim sort algorithm which is hybrid sort of merge sort and insertion sort.

Complexity of tim sort
Worst complexity: n*log(n)
Average complexity: n*log(n)
Best complexity: n
Space complexity: n 

arr.index(n)
returns the index of 'n' in arr list. if n not found then returns -1

Combinations
from itertools import combinations   
comb = combinations([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)   
for i in list(comb): 
    print(i)

Permutations
from itertools import permutations 
perm = permutations([1, 2, 3, 4], 2) 
for i in list(perm): 
    print(i)
