Read input from stdin

import sys
a = sys.stdin.readline()

Readline and convert 12 23 453 23 12 into integer list
arr = list(map(int,input().split()))

Sorting
arr.sort() 
It uses tim sort algorithm which is hybrid sort of merge sort and insertion sort.

Complexity
Worst complexity: n*log(n)
Average complexity: n*log(n)
Best complexity: n
Space complexity: n 

arr.index(n)
returns the index of 'n' in arr list.
if not found then return -1
